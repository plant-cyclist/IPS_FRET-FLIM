### Tau_Av_Int Extraction Script

### Author:         Leander Rohr, ZMBP TÃ¼bingen

### Purpose:        Extract tau_Av_Int [ns] values from .dat files exported by Symphotime and generate corresponding CSV files.

### License:        [GPL-3.0 license]

### Last Updated:   [2024-12-05]


### Description:
###     - Place all .dat files in a single folder.
###     - Set the path to the folder (see line 37)
###     - The script processes each .dat file and generates a CSV file with the extracted values.
###     - If required, missing dependencies are installed automatically.
